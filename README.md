# income-binary-classifier
This project examines whether someone's income will be above or below $50K. The focus of the project is on EDA to help understand the data. 

The ultimate goal of this project is to predict whether someoneâ€™s income will be above or below $50,000 based on information about them like their age and education. This notebook is primarily devoted to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to better understand the data and help explain what may be drivers of high income. It also helps determine feature engineering like grouping.
The modeling work will be done later in another notebook in this project. A number of different models (logistic regression, KNN, decision trees) will be used to find the model that makes the best predictions.

This data set is based on the income data set at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income
